        appearance and nutritional well-being of an individual.<br>
        Foods, as meals, are eaten at certain times of the day.<br>
         We then have breakfast, lunch and dinner to remove hunger<br>
          at periodic intervals of the day. In between these meals, <br>
          people still eat for pleasure. Certain foods are usually <br>
          associated with the meals of the day. Breads, eggs, yams, <br>
          cereals, fruit juices, bacon and sausage are closely associated <br>
          with breakfast. Pounded yam, Amala. Eba, Semovita, Egusi soup <br>
          (melon soup), Okro soups, Rice, Beans Fried plantains are often more <br>
          closely associated with lunch and dinner.<br>
